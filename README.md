Run `go install github.com/gov4git/gov4git`.

## Quick start

## Motivation

## Roadmap

- A framework for building decentralized social applications, based on the git protocol
  - Identity management
  - Signed and encrypted messaging across repos
- Applications
  - Governance for community source projects
    - Membership management
    - Verifiable record of referendum proceedings
    - Verifiable polling
    - Directory-level configurability of governance policies
    - Supported arbitration policies
      - Vote (members vote, using a custom weighting function and threshold)
      - Quorum (at least N approvals out of M members)

## Vision

We think our framework for social applications over git has a huge potential in a variety of domains, e.g.
  - Auctions over git
  - Twitter over git
  - Gaming over git (e.g. chess, go)
