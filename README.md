# Decentralized governance for git communities

Welcome! This repository hosts the code of gov4git â€” a decentralized protocol for governing open-source communities based on git. We created gov4git to aid us in experimenting with organization and incentive mechanisms that stimulate happy, productive and fair open source communities.

## Documentation

gov4git is a framework for programming and deploying governance applications. It is based on a new, radically simple and powerful software architecture for decentralized applications and trusted computation.

- [Summary](https://github.com/gov4git/doc/blob/main/summary/summary.md) of gov4git for users
- [Whitepaper](https://github.com/gov4git/doc/blob/main/whitepaper/whitepaper.md) describing the software architecture underlying gov4git

## Status

Gov4git has reached an [MVP milestone](https://github.com/gov4git/doc/blob/main/roadmap/gov4git_roadmap.md), which includes a variety of features:
- identity system for community members
- community user and group management
- polling for prioritizing work (such as issues or pull requests) based on quadratic voting
- community-scoped fungible and non-fungible currencies (such as voting credits and badges) and services (such as transfers)

At the moment the gov4git protocol is implemented by our reference command-line client. We are working on building a web UI to facilitate non-technical users.

## Dogfood

We are using gov4git to govern our own community and improve the protocol with practice. Everyone is invited to [join the community](doc/dogfood/how-to-join.md) and try the system.
