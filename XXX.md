- update GOVERN.md with known subtleties:
  - vulnerability: community members must not be allowed to close issues to prevent them from closing before a pr is submitted
- update GOVERN-PLAYBOOK.md

- metrics
  - split vote count and vote spend to issues and prs
  - test integration of metrics

- dynamic ownership graph over account IDs
  - objects (like ballot, motion, etc) register themselves with the ownership system?
  - ballot can query about its owner (accounts already have owners)
