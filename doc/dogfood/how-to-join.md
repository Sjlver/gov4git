# How to join our governance community

Welcome and thank you for your interest in gov4git!

Our community is governed by a dogfood release of our own software â€” gov4git.

We welcome anyone to join and take our governance system for a spin.

In order to join, please follow these steps:

- Create two empty repositories, which will host your public and private identity for the purposes of participating in community governance.

  Your public repository should be publically readable. For instance, mine is hosted on GitHub and its URL is [https://github.com/petar/gov4git.public.git](https://github.com/petar/gov4git.public.git).

  Your private repository should NOT be publically readable. For instance, mine is [https://github.com/petar/gov4git.private](https://github.com/petar/gov4git.private).

  Decide what is the name of the branch (inside your repos) that will host your gov4git-related data. Using `main` is a good convention.

- Request to join the gov4git community using [this form](https://github.com/gov4git/gov4git/issues/new?assignees=petar&labels=community&template=join.yml&title=I%27d+like+to+join+this+project%27s+community).

   You will receive a confirmation once you've been added to the community members. 

   At this point, you can start participating in our governance by following [these instructions](how-to-participate.md).

If you run into problems, [let us know](https://github.com/gov4git/gov4git/issues/new/choose).
